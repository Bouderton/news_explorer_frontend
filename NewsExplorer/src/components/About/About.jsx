            Hey there, Iâ€™m Ryan Khazal, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer
            from Las Vegas, Nevada. My journey into web development began at
            TripleTen, where I not only discovered my love for coding but also
            developed a solid foundation in various technologies. At TripleTen,
            I mastered the essentials like HTML and CSS and progressed into more
            advanced areas such as JavaScript, React, Node, and Express. I also
            became proficient in Git, which has been invaluable for managing and
            collaborating on projects. I truly enjoyed my time at TripleTen,
            where I gained the skills and confidence to tackle a wide range of
            development challenges. As a recent graduate, I am ready to take on
            a fulfilling and successful career!
